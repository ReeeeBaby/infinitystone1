	<h1 align="center">Superhero trivia</h1>	<h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
	<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero,<b> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise< a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p>
	<p> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<p><i>article on superheroes at </i><a href="ttps://blog.oup.com/2018/11/stan-lee-what-is-a-superhero/">OUP blog</a></p>
